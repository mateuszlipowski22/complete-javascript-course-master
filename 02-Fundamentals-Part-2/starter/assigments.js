// LECTURE: Functions
// 1. Write a function called 'describeCountry' which takes three parameters:
// 'country', 'population' and 'capitalCity'. Based on this input, the
// function returns a string with this format: 'Finland has 6 million people and its
// capital city is Helsinki'
// 2. Call this function 3 times, with input data for 3 different countries. Store the
// returned values in 3 different variables, and log them to the console

function describeCountry(country, population, capitalCity) {
    return `${country} has ${population} million people and its capital city is ${capitalCity}`;
}

const firstCountry = describeCountry("Poland", "37", "Warsaw");
const seconfCountry = describeCountry("Germany", "60", "Berlin");
const thirdCountry = describeCountry("Ukraine", "50", "Kiev");

console.log(firstCountry);
console.log(seconfCountry);
console.log(thirdCountry);


// LECTURE: Function Declarations vs. Expressions
// 1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration
// called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and
// returns the percentage of the world population that the given population
// represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of
// the world population
// 2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900
// and then multiply by 100
// 3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice,
// store the results into variables, and log them to the console
// 4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called
// 'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be
// the same populations)

const chinaPopulation = 1441;
const indiaPopulation = 1022;
const polandPopulation = 40;


function percentageOfWorld1(population) {
    return (population / 7900 * 100);
}

const percentageOfWorld2 = function (population) {
    return population / 7900 * 100;
}
const chinaPercentage = percentageOfWorld1(chinaPopulation)
const indiaPercentage = percentageOfWorld1(indiaPopulation);
const polandPercentage = percentageOfWorld1(polandPopulation);

console.log(chinaPercentage);
console.log(indiaPercentage);
console.log(polandPercentage);

console.log(percentageOfWorld2(chinaPopulation));
console.log(percentageOfWorld2(indiaPopulation));
console.log(percentageOfWorld2(polandPopulation));

// LECTURE: Arrow Functions
// 1. Recreate the last assignment, but this time create an arrow function called
// 'percentageOfWorld3'

const percentageOfWorld3 = population => population / 7900 * 100;
console.log(percentageOfWorld3(chinaPopulation));
console.log(percentageOfWorld3(indiaPopulation));
console.log(percentageOfWorld3(polandPopulation));

// LECTURE: Functions Calling Other Functions
// 1. Create a function called 'describePopulation'. Use the function type you
// like the most. This function takes in two arguments: 'country' and
// 'population', and returns a string like this: 'China has 1441 million people,
// which is about 18.2% of the world.'
// 2. To calculate the percentage, 'describePopulation' call the
// 'percentageOfWorld1' you created earlier
// 3. Call 'describePopulation' with data for 3 countries of your choice

const describePopulation = function (country, population) {
    const percentageOfWorldPop = percentageOfWorld1(population);
    return `${country} has ${population} million people, which is about ${percentageOfWorldPop}% of the world.`;
}

console.log(describePopulation("China", chinaPopulation));
console.log(describePopulation("India", indiaPopulation));
console.log(describePopulation("Poland", polandPopulation));


// LECTURE: Introduction to Arrays
// 1. Create an array containing 4 population values of 4 countries of your choice.
// You may use the values you have been using previously. Store this array into a
// variable called 'populations'
// 2. Log to the console whether the array has 4 elements or not (true or false)
// 3. Create an array called 'percentages' containing the percentages of the
// world population for these 4 population values. Use the function
// 'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier to compute the 4
// percentage values

const populations = [40, 1333, 120, 220];

if (populations.length === 4) {
    console.log(populations);
}

const percentages = [percentageOfWorld1(populations[0]), percentageOfWorld1(populations[1]), percentageOfWorld1(populations[2]), percentageOfWorld1(populations[3])]

console.log(percentages);


// LECTURE: Basic Array Operations (Methods)
// 1. Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of a country of your
// choice. Choose a country which has at least 2 or 3 neighbours. Store the array
// into a variable called 'neighbours'
// 2. At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of
// your selected country. So add it to the end of the 'neighbours' array
// 3. Unfortunately, after some time, the new country is dissolved. So remove it from
// the end of the array
// 4. If the 'neighbours' array does not include the country â€˜Germanyâ€™, log to the
// console: 'Probably not a central European country :D'
// 5. Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that, find the
// index of the country in the 'neighbours' array, and then use that index to
// change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for
// 'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'.

const neighbours = ['Germany', 'Czech Republic', 'Slovakia', 'Ukraine'];
neighbours.push('Utopia');
neighbours.pop();

console.log(neighbours);

if (!neighbours.includes('Germany')) {
    console.log(`Probably not a central European country :D`);
}

neighbours[neighbours.indexOf('Germany')] = 'Belarus';

console.log(neighbours);


// LECTURE: Introduction to Objects
// 1. Create an object called 'myCountry' for a country of your choice, containing
// properties 'country', 'capital', 'language', 'population' and
// 'neighbours' (an array like we used in previous assignments)

const myCountry = {
    country: 'Poland',
    capital: 'Warsaw',
    language: 'polish',
    population: 40,
    neighbours: ['Germany', 'Czech Republic', 'Slovakia', 'Ukraine']
}

console.log(myCountry);


// LECTURE: Dot vs. Bracket Notation
// 1. Using the object from the previous assignment, log a string like this to the
// console: 'Finland has 6 million finnish-speaking people, 3 neighbouring countries
// and a capital called Helsinki.'
// 2. Increase the country's population by two million using dot notation, and then
// decrease it by two million using brackets notation.

console.log(`${myCountry.country} has ${myCountry.population} million ${myCountry.language}-speaking people, ${myCountry.neighbours.length} neighbouring countries
and a capital called ${myCountry.capital}.`);

myCountry.population = myCountry.population - 2;
console.log(myCountry.population);
myCountry['population'] = myCountry['population'] + 2;
console.log(myCountry.population);


// LECTURE: Object Methods
// 1. Add a method called 'describe' to the 'myCountry' object. This method
// will log a string to the console, similar to the string logged in the previous
// assignment, but this time using the 'this' keyword.
// 2. Call the 'describe' method
// 3. Add a method called 'checkIsland' to the 'myCountry' object. This
// method will set a new property on the object, called 'isIsland'.
// 'isIsland' will be true if there are no neighbouring countries, and false if
// there are. Use the ternary operator to set the property.

myCountry.describe = function () {
    return `${this.country} has ${this.population} million ${this.language}-speaking people, ${this.neighbours.length} neighbouring countries
and a capital called ${this.capital}.`
}

console.log(myCountry.describe());

myCountry.checkIsland = function () {
    this.isIsland = this.neighbours.length === 0 ? true : false;
    return this.isIsland;
}

myCountry.checkIsland();
console.log(myCountry.isIsland);

// LECTURE: Iteration: The for Loop
// 1. There are elections in your country! In a small town, there are only 50 voters.
// Use a for loop to simulate the 50 people voting, by logging a string like this to
// the console (for numbers 1 to 50): 'Voter number 1 is currently voting'

for (let rep = 1; rep <= 50; rep++) {
    console.log(`Voter number ${rep} is currently voting`);
}

// LECTURE: Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing
// 1. Let's bring back the 'populations' array from a previous assignment
// 2. Use a for loop to compute an array called 'percentages2' containing the
// percentages of the world population for the 4 population values. Use the
// function 'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier
// 3. Confirm that 'percentages2' contains exactly the same values as the
// 'percentages' array that we created manually in the previous assignment,
// and reflect on how much better this solution is


const percentages2 = [];
for (let i = 0; i < populations.length; i++) {
    percentages2.push(percentageOfWorld1(populations[i]))
}

console.log(percentages);
console.log(percentages2);


// LECTURE: Looping Backwards and Loops in Loops
// 1. Store this array of arrays into a variable called 'listOfNeighbours'
// [['Canada', 'Mexico'], ['Spain'], ['Norway', 'Sweden',
// 'Russia']];
// 2. Log only the neighbouring countries to the console, one by one, not the entire
// arrays. Log a string like 'Neighbour: Canada' for each country
// 3. You will need a loop inside a loop for this. This is actually a bit tricky, so don't
// worry if it's too difficult for you! But you can still try to figure this out anyway ðŸ˜‰

const listOfNeighbours = [['Canada', 'Mexico'], ['Spain'], ['Norway', 'Sweden', 'Russia']];

for (let i = 0; i < listOfNeighbours.length; i++) {

    for (j = 0; j < listOfNeighbours[i].length; j++) {
        console.log(listOfNeighbours[i][j]);
    }

}
