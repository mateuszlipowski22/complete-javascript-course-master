// Working With Arrays
// Coding Challenge #1
// Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners
// about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For
// now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy.
// A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years
// old.
// Your tasks:
// Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages
// ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:
// 1. Julia found out that the owners of the first and the last two dogs actually have
// cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat
// ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function
// parameters)
// 2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
// 3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1
// is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy
// üê∂ ")
// 4. Run the function for both test datasets
// Test data:
// ¬ß Data 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
// ¬ß Data 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
// Hints: Use tools from all lectures in this section so far üòâ
// GOOD LUCK üòÄ

const checkDogs = function (dogsJulia, dogsKate) {

// Coding Challenge #2
// Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert
// dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.
// Your tasks:
// Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's
// ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:
// 1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is
// <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old,
// humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4
// 2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as
// keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
// 3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know
// from other challenges how we calculate averages üòâ)
// 4. Run the function for both test datasets
// Test data:
// ¬ß Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
// ¬ß Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
// GOOD LUCK üòÄ

    //   if (dogAge <= 2) {
    //     return dogAge * 2;
    //   } else {
    //     return 16 + dogAge * 4;
    //   }
    // })
    .map(dogAge => (dogAge <= 2 ? dogAge * 2 : 16 + dogAge * 4))
    .filter(humanAge => humanAge >= 18);

// Coding Challenge #3
// Rewrite the 'calcAverageHumanAge' function from Challenge #2, but this time
// as an arrow function, and using chaining!
// Test data:
// ¬ß Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]

// eating too much or too little.

// above and 10% below the recommended portion (see hint).

// 1. Loop over the 'dogs' array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate
// the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property. Do

// food, and the weight needs to be in kg)
